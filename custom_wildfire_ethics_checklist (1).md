# Ethics Checklist for Forest Wildfire Prediction Model

## 1. Data Collection
- **Input Variables**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Rainfall, Fuel Moisture, Vegetation Type, Slope, Region
- **Output Variables**: Fire Size, Fire Duration, Suppression Cost, Fire Occurrence
- Are the data sources, such as weather, vegetation, and geographic data, properly licensed and legally available? **This data was machine generated, as such it is completely random**
- Has any sensitive information, such as private property or personal location data, been anonymized? **As said above, the data was randomly generated.**
- Have you obtained consent for data collected from private or proprietary sources, such as satellite imagery or drone footage? **Same as above**

## 2. Fairness & Justice
- How will you ensure that the model’s predictions are fair and do not disproportionately affect specific regions or communities (e.g., indigenous lands, rural areas)? **Will need to make sure all regions are equally represented in order to keep predictions fair.**
- What biases might exist in the historical data (e.g., underreporting of fires in certain regions), and how will you address these to ensure the model does not unfairly target or neglect specific areas? **Historical data doesn't usually cover less population dense areas. I would need to go out of my way to find more data for less populated areas."
- How will you balance fairness in handling both false positives (predicting a fire where there is none) and false negatives (failing to predict a fire)? **It would be more dangerous in the case of a false negative, so I would dedicate more time and resources in eliminating those from the model."**
- Have you tested the model across different regions to ensure consistent performance across various forest types (tropical, temperate, etc.)? **The model was tested for western, northern, and southern regions since that is where the data we collected came from. It works in those areas."**

## 3. Transparency
- How will you ensure transparency about the data sources, algorithms, and decision-making process of the model? **While I will not display my code, I will contact any regions that I collect data from in order to make sure all locations can give informed consent to the use of their data.**
- What information will you make available to government agencies, the public, and environmental organizations? **I will make the prediciton model available to local governments and environmental organizations that want to protect their communities since that is the purpose of this model.**
- How will you communicate the model’s predictions and limitations to decision-makers so that they understand the risks involved? **I will let them know the R^2 and RMSE values so that they can better understnad the accuracy of the model.**
- How will you explain false positives and false negatives to the affected communities or stakeholders, especially during critical events like evacuations? **I would explain that the model can never be perfect.**

## 4. Privacy
- How will you ensure the privacy of individuals whose data might be inadvertently captured (e.g., campers, rural residents) through satellite images, drones, or weather stations? **I will kee all data sources anonymous and generalized, which will hurt the model's accuracy, but will do a better job of protecting individuals' data.**
- What steps will you take to prevent the misuse of this data, especially in terms of tracking human activities in forest areas without their consent? **I will not give all details of the data to governments, just the working part of the model, in order to prevent this.**
- If external data sources, such as drones or surveillance tools, are integrated into the model, how will you balance the need for accurate predictions with protecting individual privacy? **I can keep the data anonymous, and not give the exact data to anyone.**

## 5. Accountability
- Who will be held accountable if the model incorrectly predicts a wildfire, resulting in unnecessary evacuations or failure to prevent a disaster? **I don't think anyone should be held accountable since the model is know to not be perfect. If anyone it should be me since I made the model, but it can always be improved.**
- What system will you establish to monitor and adjust the model over time, ensuring it adapts to changing environmental and climate conditions? **I will constantly collect new data to make sure the data is updating, and remove older data points that become outdated.**
- How will you communicate accountability measures to the public, especially in high-risk areas where wildfire prediction is critical? **I will be transparent about the model's limitations in order to best communicate the model's capabilities.**

## 6. Inclusivity
- How will you ensure the model includes diverse data from different types of forests (e.g., tropical, temperate) and regions, especially those that may be underrepresented in historical data collection? **I will analyze the location data and focus data collection on less represented areas.**
- How will you ensure the model accounts for the needs of different communities, including vulnerable populations such as indigenous groups or rural residents who have unique relationships with the land? **I will communicate with these communities in order to make sure I am respecting their cultures.**
- If certain regions or communities lack sufficient data (e.g., underreporting, lack of resources), how will you address this to avoid biased predictions? **I will try to collect more data from these communities over time in order to reduce the bias in the model.**

## 7. Sustainability
- How will the model’s predictions affect long-term forestry practices, land management, and firefighting strategies over time? **It should help fire fighters respond more quickly to fires and protect the forests.**
- How will you ensure the model remains sustainable, considering the evolving nature of climate change and its effects on wildfire patterns? **I will make sure the model evolves with the changing climate.**
- What are the broader social and environmental implications if this model becomes widely adopted (e.g., impacts on land use, deforestation policies, wildlife conservation)? **People may become too reliant on the model and trust it more than anything else, resulting in more consequences in the case of a false negative or positive.**
